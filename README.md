**Original Code from: https://github.com/ushasi-bhowmick/alienworlds**

>single_LC_generator.py - Use this to create light curve of any shape

>bezier.py - This contains functions called by other python programs to generate bezier shapes

>LC_list_generator.py - This function creates a folder generatedData and contains the function generate_lc_dict(rad,edgy,noEdges,noVariety). Saves the bezier shape as jpg and  corresponding light curve as an array

>LC_list_generator_2.py - Run this file to save the bezier shapes and its corresponding light curve. This file calls the function generate_lc_dict from LC_list_generator.py. This code can be used to test any changes made in LC_list_generator.py

>plotSavedTC.py - Edit and run this file to plot any saved Transit curve

>plot_shape_testbed.py - Edit and run this file to plot any saved Bezier shape
